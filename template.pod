=head2 Synopsis

[A short description]

JavaScript backend for rakudo.

=head2 Benefits to the Perl Community

[Is this work worth doing? Why should the Perl Community grant
this project?]

=head2 Deliverables

[Quantifiable results e.g. "Improve X modules in ways Y and Z",
"Write 3 articles for X website".]

[If you cannot clearly define the deliverables, you are not quite ready
to submit this.]

Upload rakudo-js to npm and CPAN.
Have this rakudo-js be able compile our choosen subset roast to JavaScript and pass them in a modern browser.
Write a simple REPL in Perl 6 that will run in a modern browser.

=head2 Project Details

[A more detailed description.]

[It will be beneficial to include the progress made to date (if any).
If you aren't the primary maintainer of the project you want funding
for, show that you have endorsement from the primary maintainer.]

=head2 Inch-stones

[Break down your project into small chunks. By listing your tasks
adequately, other people will understand you know what you need to do.]

[Try and think in "inch-stones" rather than "mile-stones". Breaking down
your grant into many small goals makes it harder to overlook
difficulties, and easier to see progress as you complete your grant.]

=head2 Project Schedule

[How long will the project take? When can you begin work?
Be realistic.]

merged in Perl tree, or a module will be released to CPAN with the
